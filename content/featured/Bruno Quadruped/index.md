A simulation of a quadruped robot developed using C++ and ROS2 Humble. This project includes a detailed URDF model exported from SolidWorks, ROS2 packages for simulation and teleoperation. It enables autonomous navigation and real-time control through Joypad commands, offering a flexible environment for testing and refining quadruped gaits. Currently, the implementation supports trotting and crawling gaits, with plans to incorporate additional gait patterns in the future.
