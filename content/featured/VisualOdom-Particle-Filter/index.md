A vision-based localization and visual odometry system for drones utilizing particle filters and advanced image encoding techniques. This project integrates CNN and VecKM (Inner product sum) based encoders, and Histogram of Features encoders to accurately estimate similarity score to update the weights of particle filter and effeciently localize the drone.We were able to validate the performance through simulation in Gazebo and ROS2.
