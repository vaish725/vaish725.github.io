Developed a framework to evaluate temporal coherence in multimodal foundation models for video understanding tasks, introducing metrics like CLIPGain for temporal consistency in video captioning and leveraging BERTScore for semantic analysis in video QA. The project was tested on benchmarks such as TOMATO and MSR-VTT, providing nuanced insights into temporal reasoning. Open-sourced the methodology to guide advancements in time-aware AI research.
