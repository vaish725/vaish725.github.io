 A hybrid RL-MPC framework for autonomous vehicle lane-changing, integrating Soft Actor-Critic/PPO/TD3 to dynamically adjust risk-aware weights based on traffic conditions.Designed and trained the RL agent using a curriculum-based protocol in the SUMO simulation environment, achieving 30% higher success rates, 25% lower collision rates, and 20% faster lane-change completion compared to traditional MPC systems.
