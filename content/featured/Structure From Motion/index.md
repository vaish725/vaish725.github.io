A robust Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline implemented in Python, utilizing OpenCV and Open3D to reconstruct accurate 3D structures from sequential 2D images. This project processes image pairs to detect and match features, recover camera poses, perform triangulation, and visualize the resulting 3D point cloud, demonstrating effective 3D reconstruction and visualization capabilities.
