Developed a pipeline to enable a humanoid robot to learn human-like walking gaits using imitation learning techniques. Leveraged the Human3.6M motion capture dataset, processed via motion retargeting, to serve as expert demonstrations within the PyBullet physics simulator. Implemented and trained Actor-Critic agents using Proximal Policy Optimization for Imitation Learning (PPO-IL), demonstrating successful motion imitation of stable walking behaviors.
