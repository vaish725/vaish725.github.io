- Achieved 95% automation of the simulated testing pipeline, covering vision, Range of Motion, and wear tests for the Ion Endoluminal robot, significantly reducing the time for each simulated test by over 20%.
- Utilized MATLAB extensively to develop automation scripts that streamline complex testing procedures, eliminating manual intervention and enhancing overall testing efficiency.
- Engineered a solution to maintain intuitive video feed orientation by compensating for mechanical camera rotation inside the robot catheter, ensuring consistent user experience during operation.
- Implemented optical flow algorithms using both classical and deep learning approaches to accurately detect video stream movement and align the feed with user control inputs.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the automated testing framework met rigorous performance and reliability standards, enabling more consistent testing outcomes.
